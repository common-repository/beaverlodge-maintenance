**Requires Beaver Builder to work**

This plugin leverages the power of Beaver Builder's templates and drag and drop interface to create custom coming soon and maintenance pages.

Once active, if you are not logged in as admin, you will not see the site, only the custom template. However, if you are logged in as admin, you will be able to see and build out your site as expected.

### Features
* Easily register and create unique custom "coming soon" pages for your live site
* Supports Lite and Premium versions of Beaver Builder
* Includes free templates for you to use and upload

### Optional Extras

= Can I use the plugin without Beaver Builder? =

No. Beaverlodge Maintenance uses the Beaver Builder templates to create the page layout and display the landing page.

No. However the pro version of Beaver Builder includes som advanced modules that add more features.

= I installed the templates but cannot see all the fields? =

The templates included use advanced modules that are only available in the premium version of Beaver Builder, if you are using the Lite version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/?fla=283) to get all available options.
